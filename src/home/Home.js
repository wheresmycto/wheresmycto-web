          We know it&#39;s not always easy to be a non-technical founder.
          It&#39;s hard to earn the respect of the tech guys when you don&#39;t
          know how to code. Heck, sometimes it&#39;s even hard to trust
          they&#39;re really doing what needs to be done! That is: if you manage
          to attract them at all{' '}

          startup is on the right track...well, here it is! A community of
